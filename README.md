# RISCY VM
RISCVY VM is an attempt at writing a Dynamic Translator for the RISC-V ISA. Insperation on the design of the VM is taken from QEMU, a Fast and Protable Dynamic Translator by Fabrice Bellard. The current state is more of a proof of concept than a useful or fully fuctioning tool. 

## Components:
### VA Space Simulation
As a naive solution in current builds, the VA space will be a flat array with simple bounds checking. There will be no marking the address space in any way (ie: Code Segment, WT/WB, etc.).
### Translation of RISC-V Machine Code
Similarly to QEMU, RISCY VM will translate machine code operations into micro-operations.
### Emulation of Registers
Registers will be emulated in memory as part of an array.
### Debugger
The debugger will only be activated at the exceution of the SBREAK instruction.

## ISA
There will only be a subset of the RV32I ISA Implemented. Instructions that will be simulated are contained in the following table.

| Acronym        | Instruction           | Type  | Funct3 | Opcode[6:2] |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----- | -------- | -------- |

## Future Work
- Translation for the full RV32I Instruction set
- Dynamicallly allocated memory space WITH memory protections
- A cache of previously translated instrucitons


###### Note: No need for flags management (it doesn't appear to exist in RISC-V)
